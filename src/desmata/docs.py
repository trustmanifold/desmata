"""
This module provides the ability to view and generate desmata's docs.

It is called by a pre-commit hook to ensure that the docs at 
[polyose.github.io/desmata](https://polyose.github.io/desmata) stay up
to date with the code.

A user which already has desmata might also use these to view the docs.
This way they're not separated from the docs even if they're on a separate
network partition than github.io

To do this run:

$ desmata docs view

...and click the link.
